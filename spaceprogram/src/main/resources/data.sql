 'Columbia was the first shuttle to reach space, in 1981. Columbia carried dozens of astronauts into space during the next two decades, reaching several milestones. Columbia also underwent upgrades as technology advanced. However, the shuttle and a seven-member crew were lost over Texas when Columbia burned up during re-entry on Feb. 1, 2003. Columbia''s loss prompted NASA to do extra safety checks in orbit for all future missions.\n\nColumbia was destroyed at about 0900 EST on February 1, 2003 while re-entering the atmosphere after a 16-day scientific mission. The Columbia Accident Investigation Board determined that a hole was punctured in the leading edge on one of Columbia''s wings, made of a carbon composite.'),

Construction of the orbiter Atlantis began on March 3, 1980. The new orbiter arrived at NASA''s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on April 9, 1985, and over the next seven months was prepared for her maiden voyage. On Oct. 3, 1985, Atlantis launched on her first space flight, STS 51-J, with a classified payload for the U.S. Department of Defense.'),

The Apollo 17 lunar module also carried the name of Challenger. Like its historic predecessors, Challenger and her crews made significant scientific contributions in the spirit of exploration.\n\nChallenger launched on her maiden voyage, STS-6, on April 4, 1983. That mission saw the first spacewalk of the Space Shuttle program, as well as the deployment of the first satellite in the Tracking and Data Relay System constellation. Challenger''s service to America''s space program ended in tragedy on Jan. 28, 1986.'),

The space agency''s newest orbiter began flight operations in 1992 on mission STS-49.');
